# UtilitiesConsumptionADE

## Purpose
This as a first stab at using Python / Jupyter for Data Analysis. More specifically to look at our utilities consumption. We have solar panels and I doubt we are using them very effectively given that we are not reimbursed for production that we don't consume ourselves.

Equally, this is also an opportunity for me to take a stab at Python/Jupyter noteboooks. So this will be a mix of: 
 - Copying code pieces sourced from various guides and searches
 - Attempting to get it to run in a dev-container (want to clean out my host machine)
 - Make the setup easy to replicate (should I need to wipe my host or get a new one)
## Setup
### Running in a dev-container
I have sought inspiration in this guide:
https://keestalkstech.com/2022/08/jupyter-notebooks-vscode-dev-container-with-puppeteer-support/


## Change log
### 2022-10-11 
Reopened this dusty old project to:
- Note where I sourced the data from
- Fix some warnings (making changes to copies of data frames)
- Attempt to transition to dev-container setup in VSCode

**Notes**
- Run this to install podman: ```console sudo apt install podman podman-docker ```
- This article to replace docker desktop with Podman (best alternative) https://blog.lifeishao.com/2021/12/30/replacing-docker-with-podman-for-your-vscode-devcontainers/

### 2022-10-12
- Gave up on Podman (insert profanity here)
- Installed Docker Desktop on my machine
- No project progress registered
