# UtilitiesConsumptionADE

## Purpose
This as a first stab at using Python / Jupyter for Data Analysis. More specifically to look at our utilities consumption. We have solar panels and I doubt we are using them very effectively given that we are not reimbursed for production that we don't consume ourselves.

Equally, this is also an opportunity for me to take a stab at Python/Jupyter noteboooks. So this will be a mix of: 
 - Copying code pieces sourced from various guides and searches
 - Attempting to get it to run in a dev-container (want to clean out my host machine)
 - Make the setup easy to replicate (should I need to wipe my host or get a new one)
## Setup
### Running in a dev-container
I have sought inspiration in this guide:

## Change log
### 2022-10-11 
Reopened this dusty old project to:
- Note where I sourced the data from
- Fix some warnings (making changes to copies of data frames)
- Attempt to transition to dev-container setup in VSCode
